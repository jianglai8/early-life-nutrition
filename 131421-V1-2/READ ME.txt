The code in this replication package constructs the analysis file from the data sources (Carneiro et al, 2020) using Stata and Excel and R. 
One master file runs all of the code to generate the data for the main paper and appendix tables and figures. 
In table 9, the excel is used to make additional calculations
In table A16 an additional R script is used to make calculations. The R script and materials are provided.
The replicator should expect the code to run for about 2-6 hours.

The survey data used to support the findings of this study have been deposited in the [NAME] repository 
([DOI or OTHER PERSISTENT IDENTIFIER]). [1]. 
The data were collected by the authors, and are available under a Creative Commons Non-commercial license.

Additional data sources used:
"Data on National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) were downloaded from the U.S. 
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA, 2016). We use Table 30. 
Data can be downloaded from https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm, under “Personal Income (State and Local)”, 
select CAINC30: Economic Profile by County, then download. 
Data can also be directly downloaded using https://apps.bea.gov/regional/zip/CAINC30.zip. 
A copy of the data is provided as part of this archive. The data are in the public domain."

4. Data for motivation

* MASTER.do runs all do files necessary to produce results, with 2 exceptions (that are noted in the MASTER.do)
	* 1. additional calculations are made in excel for the IRR calculations, spreadsheet is provided with replication files 
	* 2. STATA prepares data to be used in R for the romano wolf calculations, the R code for this provided with replication files

* ado files needed to run some of the do files are provided, store them in C:\ado :
-> efftab, efftabbl, efftab_t1t2, t_bootstrap, tabrrd, prncoef, tereg_t1t2, teregbl

* necessary programs that need to be downloaded (the code to download them is included in MASTER.do)
-> carryforward
-> egenmore
-> estadd
-> listtab
-> rlasso
-> utrim
-> ineqdeco
-> eststo
-> cdfplot
-> distinct

* please add your username where currently it says 'lucy_k' and add the directory where the folder in use

* add the global for where the do files are saved, for where data is saved, for where outputs want to be stored in the MASTER.do

* you can also run an individual do file and set the folder path in the same way within that do file 
	* - you will need to add  'maxvar 20000' and 'clear all' at the begining of the do file

Folders have been created in 'Output' where the output will be exported to from the do files.

NOTE: Sometimes results are reported for the T1 and T2 groups seperately and then pooled in sheet 2 of an excel file. We report the pooled results.

FIRST: data_prep.do produces the final_lk.dta dataset needed to for the final analysis.
